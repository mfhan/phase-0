Explain why this relationship is a one-to-one to the best of your ability:
ANSWER: Families may disagree, but I believe that a pet only has one owner; at least, one main owner. I realize that an owner may have several pets, but even in those situations there is often a "lead" pet in the pack.

Release 6: Reflect

What is a one-to-one database?
Answer: It's a database that contains pairs that have a single relationship to one another. For instance, every major city in France has a cathedral church, and there is only one cathedral church per city.

What is a many-to-many database?
When would you use a many-to-many database?
Answer: A many-to-many database would be used when there are lots of ids that correspond to other ids. For instance, track-and-field athletes can potentially participate in a number of events such as 100m dash, triple jump or 400m hurdles.
What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
Answer: Not much -- the display is a bit awkward but generally SQL makes sense.
