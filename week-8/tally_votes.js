// __________________________________________
// Refactored Solution






// __________________________________________
// Reflection

// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// -- This was harder than we expected by several orders of magnitude.

// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// We used Math.max.apply ; and a lot of push.


// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
// That we need to take all the problems step by step; that we couldn't abanson an exercise no matter how intractable.
