**1. What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe functions like an architectural blueprint that indicates where shapes and texts should be on a webpage. The robustness of a wireframe will determine the strength of a website. It also helps plan the way users will interact with the site and all its functionalities, such as external links, drop-down menus, buttons.

**2. What are the benefits of wireframing?**

Wireframing allows the designer to plan the layout of a web product in its simplest form, without the added distractions of colors, fonts or content. It forces the designer to come up with the best layout without using shiny gizmos as a crutch.


**3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

Not really! Most wireframing sites and apps were cumbersome or came with a learning curve that was incompatible with my time frame. I ended up resorting to my Mac's Keynote software and ended up pushing around primitive shapes and text boxes.


**4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

It was definitely a trial-and-error process; I had a vague idea of a simple, straightforward site, and I ended up with what I consider a decently legible wireframe.


**5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

I ended up going on a wild goose chase for wireframing software, but realized that learning to use them would be time-consuming (for me, I'm sure they are great products for actual professionals).
I learned from a fellow DBC-er about Keynote.


**6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I enjoyed the freedom of coming up with a brand-new layout -- and the absolute tediousness of having to create said layout with a software I wasn't familiar with. The moving around texts and shapes, deleting false maneuvers, and making texts fit shapes were all pretty tedious for the novice that I am.
