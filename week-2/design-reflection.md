**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

1. Information gathering is the first step of web design.
The website's purpose must be determined: is to disseminate information and opinion? Promote something or someone? Sell something? The site's goals must also be delineated: do we want to build a brand? rally people to a cause? inform the public? make money?
Then the site's target audience needs to be defined, by applying, for instance, principles of design thinking which allow to draw a very fine profile of the core target -- gender, age, social group. The clearer that picture, the stronger the design is likely to be.
Finally a decision must be made on the type of content provided by the site: will it be news? opinion? information about a product? someone's extended resume?

2. Planning:
The designers must elaborate a list of the main topics and sub topics that will populate the site, while keeping in mind their target audience and the best way to help them navigate the site. The planning also includes the technologies that will be needed, what content management system will be used, and other important details.

3. Designing:
The designers and other parties will debate and determine the general look of the site, make prototype images, circulate them, and implement the arduous process of settling on a general look.

4. Development:
The site comes to life as the elements of the prototype come together to create a functional site. The home page, then a shell containing the navigational principles of the site, allow for content to be put in place. A valid front-end code will need to be put together with a focus on  functionality and accessibility.

5. Testing and Delivery:
The designer will ensure that the site is completely functional and compatible with other browsers and platforms. Once the site's domain name is registered and a web hosting service chosen, the files are uploaded onto a server using an FTP (File Transfer Protocol). Installation of plugins and the crafting of Search Engine Optimization are two crucial final elements.

6. Maintenance:
Even after the launch, the website must continue to provide new content in the form of news, blog posts, new products. It must continue to work with new browser updates and be viewable on new platforms.


**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

-- My site would essentially be a glorified resume displaying my two professional sides: as a journalist and as a web developer. It would include links to articles I've written or edited over the past years; blog posts; photos; GitHub

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

-- My target audience is the hiring manager at a major media or technology company eager to hire an experienced, multi-lingual journalist with web dev chops.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site?**

-- I want my user to browse through my articles, blog posts and photos and get a (hopefully positive) idea of how I can fit in their organization. I want them to contact me right away with a high-six-figure salary offer + stock options.


**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

--  User experience, which describes how a person feels when interacting with a system, is enhanced when there is a clear design behind it.  As websites have gained in complexity and features in a very competitive world, designing the best UX is paramount.
User experience is designed with a specific set of viewers in mind, in order deliver specific experiences and promote certain behaviors, but it won't work in every situation for every user.
While user experience and usability are often viewed as synonymous, UX addresses how a user feels when using a system while usability is about the user-friendliness and efficiency of the interface.


**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

-- User experience design is the study of how users feel about a platform or system. It includes evaluating factors such as ease of use, added value, and efficiency, in order to deliver the most pleasant experience possible.  It takes into account accessibility in a world of multiple devices and browser formats.  UX design is particularly valuable in complex websites, e-commerce platforms and interaction-rich Web applications. It is also crucial for start-ups and smaller companies that need to offer a solid user experience in the very first versions of a product or service to make it stand out.


**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

-- Actually, every component of this challenge was informative and engaging.
