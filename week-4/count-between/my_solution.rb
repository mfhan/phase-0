# Count Between

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].

# count_between is a method with three arguments:
#   1. An array of integers
#   2. An integer lower bound
#   3. An integer upper bound
#
# It returns the number of integers in the array between the lower and upper bounds,
# including (potentially) those bounds.
#
# If +array+ is empty the method should return 0

# Your Solution Below
# Despite hours spent on permutations and looking for the right syntax, this code does NOT work, and I would appreciate some guidance on how I can get more comfortable with these expressions. I worked completely on my own on this problem.

def count_between(list_of_integers, lower_bound, upper_bound)

  integers.length = 0
    if list_of_integers.length == 0
       return 0

    elsif  integers >= lower_bound.to_i || integers <= upper_bound.to_i

     count += 1
      return integers.length

    end
end
