# Concatenate Two Arrays

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].


# Your Solution Below

#Despite hours spent on permutations and looking for the right syntax, this code does NOT work, and I would appreciate some guidance on how I can get more comfortable with these expressions. I worked completely on my own on this problem.
#I did countless hours of searches but simply couldn't identify the methods that might have helped me. I was trying to go through array_2's index until the array is empty, then push everything into array_1.

def array_concat(array_1, array_2)

  while array_2.length > 1
    array_1.push {array_2.each do |array_2.length| }

    return array_1
  end

end
