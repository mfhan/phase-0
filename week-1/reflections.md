##### H5 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
-- I learned several key things, such as the power of tiny habit changes, the necessity of taking scheduled breaks and meditating, the need to silence the "lizard brain" that's motivated by fear, and the importance of using "out of the box" strategies to tackle a large task.

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
-- Time boxing consists in partitioning available time into a set limit so as to maximize the focus during a specified chunk of time and minimize distractions. I am trying to use it as a way of taking regular breaks and tackling a problematic exercise with a fresh pair of eyes.

How do you manage your time currently?
-- I plan out my learning in daily portion of 5 hours, with the hope of getting to the final output slowly and steadily. I am also counting on my ability to power through roadblocks by sheer willpower and force of panic.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
-- My strategy isn't working well. My "slow and steady" plan hits roadblocks every few minutes (!) when something in the command line or Git doesn't work well. Instead of sticking to my initial time allocation, I find myself sulking in a corner and telling myself I am the worst student DBC has ever admitted.

-- Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I will strive t employ the "give yourself less time" principle as urgency seems to be the most effective fuel for me. I am planning on "optimizing and gamifying" the mundane tasks -- make Git a game! (as improbable as that sounds). I will not, however, apply the "Try to get nothing done" principle as I'm pretty sure I'll truly get nothing done

-- What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
1.  Absorb all the material, even if I don't understand everything
2. Repeat the instructions, this time following all the directions
3. Research supplemental information on the Internet -- google up a storm
4. Be ready to answer all the questions in non-jargony, layman's terms
5. Do this in 25 minute increments, with obligatory breaks.
6. Try to find some fun in all of this.


##### H5 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
-- The shell is an interface that allows a developer to efficiently control the "raw horsepower" of a computer from one single platform. Bash is a type of shell that has gained widespread popularity in recent years.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
-- The simplicity and bareness of the command line was the major obstacle for someone like me, used to the bells and whistles of modern PC interfaces. What struck me is that the rigid structure of the commands, instead of making things simpler, actually added to the strangeness of this environment.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
-- Yes -- if there is one thing about Bash, it's that the commands are so simple that they work. I had trouble using rmdir to remove directories that were not empty, but found the solution after some googling.  I had trouble effectively using HELP.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
-- "pwd" and ls are essential in knowing where and what one is working with. "cd" is the indispensable tool to move from one directory to another.  I like "more" as it helps power through a given document with accessing it.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd:  prints working directory -- provides the correct path to a given directory

-ls:  lists directories

-mv: moves a directory

-cd: changes directory

-../ : Move one level up

-touch:  creates empty files

-mkdir: create a directory

-less :  pages through a file

-rmdir: removes (an empty) directory

-rm: removes directory and files

-help: didn't really work for me -- I used MAN for definitions and support



##### H5 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection



If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?
-- Go to GitHub, create a repo, create a README.
-- Fork that repository using the fork button,  and clone that version to your computer via the command line. Find the URL of that repo and use the git clone command in the terminal.

Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
-- Forking a repository helps keep track of the source of he original work. It also allows users to contribute back to the original repository.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
-- I was overwhelmed by the multiplicity of steps and their interconnection, which are at first sight very confusing. Toggling between git and github was cumbersome at first, but is becoming easier.
