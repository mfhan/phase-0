Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Open an account on GitHub and click on "new" under Repositories to create a new one. Copy the repository's URL and use the "git clone" command so that the version can live in your local computer.

Describe what open source means.

An open source program lets users see how it was made and allows anyone to customize it as needed. While some platforms, like the Mozilla Foundation, created the open source Firefox browser as a non-profit community, Automattic makes money by selling users services associated with the Wordpress blogging platform such as blog hosting and custom blog templates. In a third instance, social coding site GitHub lets developers put their source code up on its platform, and allows anyone to copy it, make changes, and attempt to persuade the original developer to use those changes.


What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?


Assess the importance of using licenses.

Instead of having a programmer just plop down a piece of work in the whole wide world, open source licenses allow others to contribute to a shared item without need for a special permission It protects the original creator and prevent others from taking credit for the work.


What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I struggled mightily during the entire Git/GitHub challenge with keeping track of branches and directories. I had to create a second branch to troubleshoot a stubborn lack of communication between master and the first branch.
I am now more than ever vigilant on WHERE I am in the shell and how to keep my repositories as clean as possible.
I had an "Aha" moment when, after mindlessly erasing a document on GitHub, I realized I couldn't re-upload a new version of that doc from the existing branch. So I ended up creating another branch and committing from there.

Girl Develop It has a great series of slides on GitHub. So does Skillcrush.

Using your new git and GitHub skills, commit and push your changes to your remote repository and go through the pull request process! Make sure you can see your reflection on GitHub.
