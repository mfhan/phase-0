Question: How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

-- We can use the Dev Tools inspector to access the css of a given page and manipulate the property and value of each element: size, color, margin padding, positioning etc. We can work on the body or div or any selector in order to modify an element's behavior.

Question: How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

-- We can resize absolute width and height in pixels or ems;
-- We can also resize according to the size of the screen by using percentages;
-- we can resize the border of an element;
-- We can manipulate parent elements in order to resize the child element.


Question: What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

A static position means that the element isn't positioned in any special way and remains unaffected by properties such as top, bottom, left, right. It is the default positioning for all elements.
A fixed element is positioned within the dimensions of the browser window and remains anchored in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
Relative positioning means that an element is placed relative to its default (static) position; changing its properties will move it from its normal position, without affecting other content. Absolute means that an element is positioned relative to the nearest parent element that is not static. It allows better cross-browser support and makes the element less dependent on margins.
For the purpose of this exercise, we found that fixed and static positions were easiest to use.


Question: What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

Within the "box model" that governs CSS, the padding is a transparent element that clears a perimeter around the HTML content; it is surrounded by a border,  which marks a visible boundary.  The margin is a transparent element that establishes an area outside the border.


Question: What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I came into the challenge feeling I didn't have the skills or knowledge to make all these boxes move; lo and behold, and thanks to a very productive interaction with my pair, I ended up having fun looking up ways to address each challenge. This was a very positive experience that allowed me to appreciate the mechanism and flexibility of CSS.
