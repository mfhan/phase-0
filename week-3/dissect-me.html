    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <h2>Version Control and GitHub</h2>
    <h4>9/22/2015</h4>

    <p>
        I believe that an introduction is in order. My name is John Polhill. I am 20 years old currently living in Aurora IL and, like many of you that are reading this post, this is my first week of phase 0 in Dev Bootcamp. So, with that out of the way I will introduce the first topic. What are the benefits of version control? Well, I personally have not found version control to be very useful for the projects I would normally work on; however, that is only because I am a hobbyist when it comes to programming and all the work I do is solo and for fun.
    </p>
    <p>
         So, I have yet the need to keep record of my progress on a project. I do believe that when working on larger, team oriented projects that the benefits of using version control would increase exponentially. Having the ability to record the work of multiple parties and manage which of those works are accepted would be a huge boon to organization and productivity. As such, I am very certain that version control will become very beneficial for me in the future.

    <aside>After a week-long forced march through the rigors of Git and GitHub, I seem to have a few clues as to what they were created for.

  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?</p>
  <p>
<main>;  <nav>; <article>; <aside>; <footer>
Each of these tags provide information on the specific nature of the content that's included. It facilitates the reading of the code and also forces discipline on the web designer.</p>

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?</p>
  <p>
Elements get laid out on a page in the order prescribed by the HTML code. while the browser uses these elements in order, in some cases there might be different orders for search engines and display purposes. </p>
  <p>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? </p>
  <p>I learned once more how flexible and functional Sublime was. Creating the sublime-snippet was fun and eye-opening. </p>
  <p>
Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?</p>
I explored the wonderful world of sublime snippets and will be using these:
<br>
  <li>css.sublime-snippet;
<li>img.sublime-snippet
